                        <p id="instructions1">Start by folding the piece of paper in half.
                            After you fold it, go ahead and cut the piece of paper in half. <br>
                            Once the piece of paper is cut, you can start fan folding the papers to make the Rosette.
                            At the end, you should have two pieces of paper that are folded like a fan.
                            <br> Take glue and put it on one side of the fan and glue the two pieces together.
                            Then fold it in half and add a string to the middle and cut the string.
                            Spread out the fan, the result will be a circle Rosette.
                            <br> On a seperate pieace of paper draw a lion's face. Glue the face to the Rosette. Add the
                            eyes and make a face on the lion.

                        <div id="instructions2">Start by giving the recycled milk and juice cartons a light coat of
                            white spray paint so that
                            the package lettering wouldn’t bleed and show through the tissue paper.
                            coat the sides of the carton with school glue and apply the tissue paper squares in any
                            arrangement <br>
                            After that is done applying the tissue, gently brush the tissue squares with the sponge
                            brush to ensure that all the edges are glued down and secure. Allow to dry.
                            <br> <br>To create the roof, fold a piece of ther recycled cardboard in half
                            width-wise. Cover the cardboard with glue and tissue paper squares. Set aside and let dry.
                            If necessary, remove the plastic pouring spout with an X-Acto knife (adults only!). You can
                            also cut off any excess cardboard from the “roof ridge” if desired.<br>
                            <br>Cut an opening for the door – if you would like to make a birdhouse, use a smaller sized
                            opening; for a bird feeder, cut a large rectangular opening. About an inch
                            below the door, use the X-Acto knife to cut two small slits in an “X” shape and insert the
                            handle of a wooden spoon to create your perch. Before you push it all the way to the back of
                            the carton, add a generous dab of glue to securely attach the end of the spoon to the
                            interior back of the carton.
                            <br> <br> On your roof piece, cut two small slits about 2″ apart, and thread through the
                            ends of your twine. Tie a knot securely on the underneath side so it won’t show. Using the
                            school glue (or hot glue if you don’t want to wait for school glue to dry!), attach the roof
                            to your carton.
